# 3D Game Engline: Witch's Lair 


Witch's Lair is a project completed for PGR - Graphics Programming course at Czech technical University in Prague. 
The goal was to implement a basic 3D graphical engine suitable for future gaming development and create a scene demonstrating implemented features. 

More details about the project inspiration can be found at its specific webpage: https://cent.felk.cvut.cz/courses/PGR/archives/2019-2020/S-FEL/ryabomar/

The engine is implemented in C++ using OpenGL, for simplicity the PGR framework was used as it contains all the necessary dependencies for given project. It can be downloaded here: https://cent.felk.cvut.cz/courses/PGR/framework.html
